=== MEETING TRANSCRIPT ===
start again thank you very much for this is the Army Springfield a meeting agenda for April 8th of 2025 a committee-of-the-whole starting at exactly 1 p.m. today to do the introductions or myself my mom are Patrick attarian into my rights in descending order is Duffy Mary Glenn fuel or one I wore to is Andy kucenski the next will be there were three young Mark Miller and I should be at work for Melinda Warren and I wonder if we'll go to the proof of agendas or any amendments or deletions to that former Council nisenan then I get a show of hands of those who support you know I'm just scared I'm going to prove all that you minutes that's a committee of the whole minutes from the last time I'll be at March 11th additions deletions to the and I seen I'm just going to show hands those and support yeah I don't send this current and then we go to and finish our business first one will be a 6.1 that's the use of firearms of bylaw the draft use
and discussions on that that all
so you just came to council at a previous committee-of-the-whole there was just a few suggestions on this so we brought back some changes they've been tracked in the by-laws so Council can see what's changed there was a request to Define Centerfire rifle ammo so that has been included there other changes we talked about the shooting range and shooting gallery so there's a slight change that says does not include Shooting Gallery was removed because that is proposed within the new zoning bylaw so we remove. We just removed high-powered because now we're just talkin about Centerfire rifle so there's a few places where Hai Pyar powered rifle is removed and then just some sections of the numbering had to be updated so you'll see some numbering change and then a slight change to ad and the discharge of a firearm is not occurring in game areas 3480 or 38 so that was added in
there was also discussion on the very last page about a fine amounts that they maybe we're too low so we did look at comparables and have suggested some increases feels fine amounts
so that's the bulk of the the changes that we went with after initial discussions with Council
thank you any discussions of from accounts with regards to the Amendments of from our last March 11th
I seen them do you still do that show your support and all that will bring this Back to the Future council meeting for Council to give first reading and then if there's any other changes we want we can initiate
then we'll go to 6.22 at Sea insightly viola same process with this this was brought to council at a future at a previous Committee of the whole meeting and not a ton of changes on this one there was a comment made on my page I got six of the document where it talked about regular outdoor burning the smoke of which causes a nuisance to adjoining property because we have that address in our fire by laws we just decided to take this out instead of trying to explain what regular outdoor burning would mean because it's quite detailed in our fire by was so we just felt that it was easier to take it out of this by law all together
and the second document is the offense schedule and I know there was some comments on whether these were appropriate fine amounts I think specifically with the unsightly by law we try to get people to to work with us so the point is not to find people we always want to kind of get them to work with us willingly to correct the change so we were satisfied with the fine amounts for this by law
thank you a question so from my counselor at all
I think that's why I don't know then we'll go nothing else on the agenda except for I am 7 to close the meeting if I get a mover and check her to go into a closed and meeting Glenn and Patrick then we're going to close meeting at exactly at 1:05 p.m.
